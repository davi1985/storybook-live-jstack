### When to use

A buton means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger corresponding business logic.

We provide 5 types of buttons:

<ul className="space-y-1">
  <li>
    <strong>Default:</strong> A standard button with a solid background,
    typically used for primary actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secondary:</strong> A less prominent button, used for secondary
    actions or to complement the primary button.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Outline:</strong> A button with a transparent background and a
    visible border, often used to emphasize actions without being too bold.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ghost:</strong> A minimalist button with no background or border,
    designed to blend into the background while remaining interactive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Link:</strong> A button styled as a hyperlink, used when the action
    navigates to another page or section.
  </li>
</ul>
